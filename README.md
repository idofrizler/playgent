# Playgent Extension

Playgent is a fun and interactive VS Code extension that brings mini-games directly into your editor. Whether you're taking a break or looking for a quick challenge, Playgent has you covered!

## Games Included

- **Memory Game**: Test your memory by matching pairs of cards.
- **Simon Says**: Follow the sequence of lights and sounds to win.
- **Random xkcd**: Get random xkcd strips.

## How It Works

- The games automatically load whenever GitHub Copilot starts thinking, providing you with a fun distraction while waiting for suggestions.
- Once GitHub Copilot stops thinking, the games immediately close, allowing you to return to your work seamlessly.
- You can also manually launch games by opening the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and searching for the game you want to play.

## When to Use

- **Take a Break**: Use Playgent to relax during your coding sessions.
- **Challenge Yourself**: Compete with friends or colleagues to achieve the highest scores.
